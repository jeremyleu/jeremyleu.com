This is the source code for my [personal website](https://www.jeremyleu.com). I wrote it in April 2019 to give it some much-needed content and technology updates, using React, TypeScript, GatsbyJS (and by extension, GraphQL), and Emotion for CSS-in-JS. I also wanted to try out [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/), which was really awesome.
